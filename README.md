    - For both users and developers:
        - `curl -L https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader/raw/main/dist/uninstall.sh | sh`

### Developing plugins
- There is no complete plugin development documentation yet. However a good starting point is the [Plugin Template](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/Plugin-Template) repository

## Features
- Clean injecting and loading of one or more plugins
- Persistent. It doesn't need to be reinstalled after every system update 
- Allows 2-way communication between the plugins and the loader.
- Allows plugins to define python functions and run them from javascript.
- Allows plugins to make fetch calls, bypassing cors completely.

## Caveats

- You can only interact with the Plugin Menu via touchscreen.
